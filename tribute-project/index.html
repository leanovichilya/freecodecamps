        <h2>Life and career</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Miles was born on 1 November 1918 in Sutton Coldfield, a short
            distance from the city of Birmingham
          </li>
          <li>
            He raced motorcycles before he served in the British Territorial
            Army in World War II
          </li>
          <li>
            Miles spent the next seven years working in machinery and was
            promoted to the rank of staff sergeant in 1942
          </li>
          <li>
            He was stationed in a tank unit that took part in the Normandy
            landings in 1944
          </li>
          <li>
            After the war, he raced Bugattis, Alfa Romeos, and Alvises with the
            Vintage Sports Car Club. He then turned to a Ford V8 Frazer-Nash
          </li>
          <li>
            In 1952 Miles moved from England to the US, and settled in Los
            Angeles, California as a service manager for the Southern California
            MG distributor
          </li>
          <li>
            In 1953, he won 14 straight victories in SCCA racing in an MG-based
            special of his own design and construction
          </li>
          <li>
            For the 1955 season, he designed, constructed and campaigned a
            second special based on MG components that was known as the "Flying
            Shingle"
          </li>
          <li>
            During 1956, Miles raced John von Neumann's Porsche 550 Spyder at
            most of the Cal Club and SCCA events
          </li>
          <li>
            For the 1957 season (in co-operation with Otto Zipper), Miles
            engineered the installation of a Porsche 550S engine and
            transmission in a 1956 Cooper chassis and body
          </li>
          <li>
            He played a key role in the development and success of the racing
            versions of the Shelby Cobra 289 in SCCA, USRRC and FIA sports car
            racing between 1962 and 1965 as well as the Daytona Coupe and 427
            versions of the Cobra and the Ford GT (GT40)
          </li>
          <li>He became the chief test driver of Shelby-American in 1963</li>
          <li>
            Miles had a "reputation for courtesy on the track" and was sometimes
            called the "Stirling Moss of the West Coast". While a member of the
            AC-Cobra Ford Team, Miles entered a Lotus 23 in the 1964 Player's
            200 at Mosport
          </li>
          <li>
            In 1965, he shared a Ford GT Mk.II with Bruce McLaren at the 24
            Hours of Le Mans but retired with gearbox trouble. Earlier in the
            year, also with McLaren, he had finished second at the 12 Hours of
            Sebring
          </li>
          <li>
            The next year he won the 24 Hours of Daytona, sharing the Ford GT
            Mk.II with Lloyd Ruby, and then won the 12 Hours of Sebring
          </li>
          <li>
            Several months later, sharing the drive with Denny Hulme, Miles was
            leading the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans, but Ford executive Leo Beebe,
            desiring a publicity photo of three of their cars crossing the
            finish line together, instructed Carroll Shelby to order him to slow
            down, which Shelby agreed to. Accordingly, the next car from Ford
            driven by Bruce McLaren/Chris Amon and the third-place car from Ford
            drew up, and they cruised to the line together
          </li>
          <li>
            17 August 1966 after almost a day of testing at Riverside
            International Raceway in the brutally hot Southern California desert
            summer weather, Miles approached the end of the track's 1-mile (1.6
            km), downhill back straight at top speed (200-plus mph) when the car
            suddenly looped, flipped, crashed and caught fire. The car broke
            into pieces and ejected Miles, killing him instantly
          </li>
        </ul>

            I am a mechanic. That has been the direction of my entire vocational
            life. Driving is a hobby, a relaxation for me, like golfing is to
            others. I should like to drive a Formula One machine, not for the
            grand prize, but just to see what it is like. I should think it
            would be jolly good fun!
